# Viktor_Kim_SVG_Icons
 
## About
In this exercise I created 6 static and 6 animated icons for my website.

## Functionality
I decided to make my icons rotate as this option is the most appropriate.

## Problems
Javascript only works for static icons but gives an error for animated icons. I tried to fix this error but did not find the answer.
